## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Are you remodeling a room in your house? It can be difficult to keep track of everything when you are shopping for multiple items. This app can allow you to categorize items to compare after you shop. You can save items you see along the way and easily compare them to decide what works best. For example, you are wanting a new chair. You look at 5 different places, but not making a decision yet. You can store the pictures, cost, measurements, etc all together to look at on a grid later to make a final decision.
I did a remodel on multiple rooms in my house, shopping at many stores. I was constantly scrolling through pictures on my phone to remember what I had already found and what store it was in. This would allow you to log all your ‘finds’ in one place to access when needed. Also keep a spending tracker vs budget as you go!
